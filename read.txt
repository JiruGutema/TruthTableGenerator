This code helps to generate truth tables for given logical expressions. The program takes user input for a logical expression and then prints the truth table for that expression. The program also returns the minimum and maximum terms for the given expression.

How to use
Run the program in your Python environment (for example, IDLE, VS Code, or PyCharm).
Enter a logical expression when prompted. The expression can only contain up to four variables (A, B, C, and D), and the supported operators are 'and', 'or', 'not', '>>', '^', and '()'.
Press Enter to generate the truth table for the entered expression.
The program will print the truth table and the corresponding minimum and maximum terms for the expression.
Example
please enter expression: A and B
A | B | A and B
----------
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

Minimum Term:  AB
Maximum Term:  A̅+B̅
